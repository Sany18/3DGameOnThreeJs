Author's description:

A set of Synthwave/Retrowave cursors I made back in 2016, I was intending to make a matching set of icons to go with them but I never got around to it! Maybe if there's enough interest in these I'll go for it and make some icons to match :)

The waiting/busy cursors ARE animated, I'm unsure if it shows up in preview?
